# Data Format Conversion:
    - This repo is about converting files between different delimiter-spaced-formats using SML language.
    - Run 2019CS50586_csv2tsv.sml and call function convertDelimeters(infilename, delim1, outfilename, delim2) to convert infile with delim1 ton delim2
    - You can directly convert csv file to tsv file and vice versa by calling csv2tsv(infilename, outfilename) and tsv2csv(infilename, outfilename).
